**Behavioral Cloning Project**

The goals / steps of this project are the following:
* Use the simulator to collect data of good driving behavior
* Build, a convolution neural network in Keras that predicts steering angles from images
* Train and validate the model with a training and validation set
* Test that the model successfully drives around track one without leaving the road
* Summarize the results with a written report

## Rubric Points
### Here I will consider the [rubric points](https://review.udacity.com/#!/rubrics/432/view) individually and describe how I addressed each point in my implementation.

### Files Submitted & Code Quality

#### 1. Submission includes all required files and can be used to run the simulator in autonomous mode
My project includes the following files:
* model.py containing the script to create and train the model
* drive.py for driving the car in autonomous mode
* model.h5 containing a trained convolution neural network 
* writeup.md summarizing the results
* model_video.mp4 containing the driving movie generated by model.h5
* loss.png shows training & validation error losses


#### 2. Submission includes functional code
Using the Udacity provided simulator and my drive.py file, the car can be driven autonomously around the track by executing 

```sh
python drive.py model.h5
```


#### 3. Submission code is usable and readable
The model.py file contains the code for training and saving the convolution neural network at the train function. 
The function shows the pipeline I used for training and validating the model, and the nvidia_model function 
show the used model architecture.


### Model Architecture and Training Strategy

#### 1. An appropriate model architecture has been employed
My model input is an RGB image(160x320x3), and the output is one value of steering angle.
The model consists of a convolution neural network with 5x5 filter sizes and depths between 24 and 64 (model.py lines 22-26)
The model includes RELU layers to introduce nonlinearity, and the data is normalized in the model using a Keras lambda layer (code line 18). Also, the network crops the input image in order to pay attention to only the road surface (model.py line 20).
 

#### 2. Attempts to reduce overfitting in the model
The model contains dropout layers in order to reduce overfitting (model.py line 27). 
The model was trained and validated on different data sets to ensure that the model was not overfitting (code line 90). 
The model was tested by running it through the simulator and ensuring that the vehicle could stay on the track.

#### 3. Model parameter tuning
The model used an adam optimizer, so the learning rate was not tuned manually (model.py line 94).

#### 4. Appropriate training data
Training data was chosen to keep the vehicle driving on the road. I used a combination of center lane driving, 
reverse driving, recovering from the left and right sides of the road.

For details about how I created the training data, see the next section. 

### Model Architecture and Training Strategy

#### 1. Solution Design Approach
My first step was to use the neural network proposed by Nvidia.
For details about the network, see the next section. 

In order to gauge how well the model was working, I split my image and steering 
angle data into a training and validation set. I found that my first model had 
a low mean squared error on the training set but a high mean squared error on 
the validation set. This implied that the model was overfitting. 
The mean squared error is shown below.

When I ran the car on track 1, the car fell off the track with a curve against the pond.
This failure is due to recovery driving on this curve and overfitting of the straight 
angle data at the track edge just before recovery.

To reduce overfitting, I added a DropOut layer to the model and reduced the number of epochs from 15 to 5.
This prevented the car from falling off the truck.
The improved mean squared error is shown below.

#### 2. Final Model Architecture
I used the famous end-to-end neural network created by Nvidia[1],
and I added a Lambda Layer for normalize pixel values at the front of the network.
The Nvidia model consisted of the following layers:

| Layer         		|     Description	        					| 
|:---------------------:|:---------------------------------------------:| 
| Input 				| 160x320x3 RGB image 							| 
| Lambda 				| Normalize(inputx/255-0.5), outputs 160x320x3 	|
| Cropping2D 			| Cropping top:75 bottom:25, outputs 65x320x3 	|

#### 3. Creation of the Training Set & Training Process
To capture good driving behavior, I first recorded two laps on track one using center lane driving. Here is an example image of center lane driving:

![alt text][image3]

Second, I recorded one laps on the reverse track one center lane driving. Here is an example image of center lane reverse driving:

![alt text][image4]

I then recorded the vehicle recovering from the left side and right sides of the road back to center so that the vehicle would learn 
to correct the course when the vehicle deviates from the center. These images show the course correction from the edge of the track to the center.

There are many left corner images because the track one is a round course. 
Therefore, the images are flipped to increase the data in the right corner. 
For example, here is an image that has then been flipped:

![alt text][image8]

After the collection process, I had X number of data points. I then preprocessed this data by using images of 3 camera:
left camera, center camera, right camera. 
The left camera data has an angle correction of 0.2, and the right camera data has a correction of -0.2.

I finally randomly shuffled the dataset and put 20% of the data into a validation set. 
I used this training data for training the model. The validation set helped determine if the model was over or under fitting. 
The ideal number of epochs was 5 as evidenced by the suppression of overfitting mentioned above.  
I used an adam optimizer so that manually training the learning rate wasn't necessary.
